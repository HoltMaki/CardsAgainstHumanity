Look into using mock objects (Big Java page 483-484) to test parts of the program.


Basics:

X	Step 1: Cards (Package) - ?This applys to players/users and game as well? 
							  The cards a player plays must have something that tells the commputer who played the card 
							  so that it can award awesome points to whoever played the card.
							  Cards: work on tagging.
							  Tagging IDEA: make it so that in a game a certain combonation of cards can be tagged.
							  				Tags like PERSONAL_CZAR, PERSONAL_SELF, or INSIDE
							  				could be used so that the computer could understand that the joke
							  				doesnt apply to everyone, just the Card Czar, the person who plays the card,
							  				or the group of people playing the game.
							  ??S - taging for just aCards or also for qCards? should those tags be consolodated or seperate?
							  	  - Enum and/or class???
X	Step 2: users (Package) - More work still needed(See step 5)...
	Step 3: game (Package): PRIORITIES: CAH_Game, playerManager; Figure out how to mangage the players.
	Step 4: ai (Package)
	Step 5:	user package - add the other stuff once the other classes are done.
			REPLACE ALL PROTECTED VARIABLES WITH PRIVATE ONES, AND MAKE THE PROGRAM SO THAT IT CAN WORK WITH THE PRIVATE VARIABLES.
			CONCEAL CODE SO THAT IT CANNOT BE ALTERED!!!!!!!!!!
	Step 6: userInterface (Package)
	Step 7a: Encryption/obviscation (package) 
	Step 7b: saving(package). ADD saveable interface to saveable objects.
	Step 8: Fix any Text File problems
	Step 9a: have people who are interested in CAH listen to the playlist Songs against humanity and provide feedback.
	Step 9b: Sounds: Songs against Humanity playlist.
	Step 10: Netplay. (Package)
	Step 11: Teach computer ai
	Step 12: Make updates possible with emails?(See ideas below) 
	Step 13: Make bug reports possible in the middle of playing (See Ideas below)
	Step 14: distrubute.
	
CARDS & Players/users: ADD EXTRA DRAW OPTION so that draw 2 works.
CARDS: Make the cards read as pick 2 in the deck builder. Add draw & pick variables to questionCard class

IDEAS:
	*Make an option in the game to have everyone's awesome points visable, just a players own awesome points visable,
	 or nobody's awesome points visable. Make this work so that the computer players cant "see" everyones points either.
	 
	*?Make an email adress that can be accesed by users to send bug reports that can be made in the middle of playing. 
	
	*?Have the email that the users can all access recieve emails that contain updates. Send out the updates with another email.
	
	*At the start have a screen that says something like warning, dont be offended, or something like that. maybe make it funny.
	
	*UI: make a method that combines the answer and question onto one card with each being a different color. Make the question and answer work for both q&a and fill in the 
	blank

Then go back and update and perfect things.

Updates:
	ExpansionDecks (Make it so that anyone can add their own expansion deck) also make it so that multiple decks can be used in
	a game and so that people can choose which decks to use.
	Make it so that eventually 
	Maybe have the program send an email to someone that will update their stats for their impersonator.
	
	Make the impersonator able to understand how perceptive of others the players. Make a thing that dertermines flexability to 
	knowing players. Do this by looking at results with different players as well as how well cards played match the other players
	behavior.
